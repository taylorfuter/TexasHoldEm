# TexasHoldEm
Texas Hold 'Em game developed for our final project of CSCI 201 at USC during Fall 2020. I collaborated with 5 other students to create the project in about 6 weeks. It features multithreading to allow multiple people to play at once, a database for users to log in, and a GUI that is friendly to the user. We also coded blackjack for guests to play.
